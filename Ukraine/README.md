## Strategic Overview

This initiative creates a **72-hour humanitarian switch**—a rapid, time-bound pause to achieve immediate wins for Ukraine's people while preserving full sovereignty and justice claims.

At its core, this mechanism prioritizes the safe return of children, the dignity of prisoners, and the protection of nuclear and energy facilities critical to millions of lives.

**Ukraine leads with a humanitarian initiative that imposes no concessions yet demonstrates moral and legal leadership at the UN.**

**Core Benefits**:
* **Children Returned**: First mass repatriation of children since invasion began—UNICEF/ICRC-led operations to reunite families within 30 days
* **Prisoners Freed**: Accelerated "all-for-all" exchanges under neutral oversight
* **Nuclear Sites Secured**: ZNPP and other facilities placed under IAEA safety regime  
* **Energy & Food Flows Restored**: Immediate lifeline for Ukraine's economy and global food security

**Key Advantage**: Zero recognition or territorial concessions—humanitarian relief without political compromise.

**This is not a political concession—it is a humanitarian lifeline. Supporting it aligns with UN Charter obligations, ICC justice tracks, and global nuclear safety.**

> ### **Humanitarian Clock Is Ticking**
